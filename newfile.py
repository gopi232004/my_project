Sure, here's a simplified example of how you can implement housing price prediction using Ridge regression in Python with scikit-learn. Make sure to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load your dataset into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('Price', axis=1)
y = data['Price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a Ridge regression model
alpha = 1.0  # You can adjust the regularization strength
ridge = Ridge(alpha=alpha)

# Train the model
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = ridge.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# You can also access the coefficients (theta) to interpret feature importance
print("Ridge Coefficients: ", ridge.coef_)
```

In this code:

1. Load your dataset (in this case, 'housing_data.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).

3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Standardize the features to ensure they are on the same scale.

5. Create a Ridge regression model with a chosen regularization strength (alpha).

6. Train the model using the training data.

7. Make predictions on the test data.

8. Evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error.

9. You can also access the model's coefficients (theta) to understand feature importance.

Make sure to replace 'housing_data.csv' with the path to your dataset and adjust the hyperparameter (alpha) based on your specific dataset and requirements.
